ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* AndroidManifest.xml
* res\
* res\drawable-v21\
* res\drawable-v21\psts_background_tab.xml
* res\drawable\
* res\drawable\psts_background_tab.xml
* res\layout\
* res\layout\psts_tab.xml
* res\values\
* res\values\attrs.xml
* res\values\colors.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* libs\android-support-v13.jar => pagerSlidingTabStrip_lib\libs\android-support-v13.jar
* src\ => pagerSlidingTabStrip_lib\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
